# Predict-Bank-Credit-Risk-using-South-German-Credit-Data
Predict Bank Credit Risk using South German Credit Data prediction using machine Learning.

# PROEBLEM STATEMENT

Normally, most of the bank's wealth is obtained from providing credit loans so that a
marketing bank must be able to reduce the risk of non-performing credit loans. The risk
of providing loans can be minimized by studying patterns from existing lending data.
One technique that you can use to solve this problem is to use data mining techniques.
Data mining makes it possible to find hidden information from large data sets by way of
classification.

# Approch

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that are the best fit for the above case.

# GOAL
The goal of this project, you have to build a model to predict whether the person,
described by the attributes of the dataset, is a good (1) or a bad (0) credit risk

# Datasource
You can get Dataset through this link:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/South+German+Credit

# Project Various Step
## Data Exploration
I started exploring datasets using pandas, NumPy,matplotlib and seaborn.


## Data visualization
Ploted colleration matrix to get insights about dependend and independed variables.
Made chats like( Bocxplot,countplot,distplot,pairplot).

## Model Selection I
Used Svm,Knn,randomForest in Stack.
used stacking ensemble technique.

## Hyperparameter Optimization
Using Randomizedsearch CV to select the best parameter for training the model

## Model Dump
As per selected trained model is dumped to pickled format for app development
